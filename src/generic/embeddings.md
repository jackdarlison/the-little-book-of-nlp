Word representations are methods of creating a numerical representation of a span of text.



## Sparse Embeddings

Sparse embeddings are a vectorised representation of a words. They are known as sparse as many of the entries in the vector will be zero 

## Dense Embeddings


#### Benefits over sparse embeddings
